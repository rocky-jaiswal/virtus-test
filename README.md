Does not look good -


    .                     user     system      total        real
    
    10000 Ruby Obects:    0.090000   0.000000   0.090000 (  0.083801)
    
    ..                    user     system      total        real
    
    10000 Virtus Obects:  6.310000   0.000000   6.310000 (  6.322598)
